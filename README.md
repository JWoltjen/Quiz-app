## Introduction

This is a simple quiz application that hits the opentdb api and fetches trivia questions based on the category of question, difficulty, question type, and number of questions asked. The application then uses Redux to keep track of the score and the question number. Once the user completes the number of questions selected, they are taken to the final screen, where they are given a total score and a link to begin the game again.
